<h1>textme: text yourself from terminal in MacOS Monterey</h1>
This configuration creates a command allowing you to text yourself from the terminal in MacOS Monterey. It does so by setting up Postfix, a mail server that is installed on MacOS by default, creating a command you can use with parameters for the email subject and body, then using your email service to send an SMS to your phone via your personal email to SMS address.

1.  determine and test your email to SMS address

First, find out what your email to SMS address is via Google. For example, T-Mobile's email to SMS syntax looks like:

  <yourphonenumber>@tmomail.net

Test this email address before continuing by emailing yourself at this address with both a subject and some content. Note whether both subject and content are supported when you receive your text. (I assume they are but I haven't tested this on multiple phone service providers.)

2. create an application-specific password

Assuming you have MFA enabled on your email account, create an application-specific password to use just for this purpose.

3.  Create an sasl_passwd file for postfix:

  sudo nano/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

Add this to the file

  smpt.youremailservice.com:port 



Create a file named "textme.sh" and add the following:

  #!/bin/bash
  
  echo "$2" | mail -s "$1" "4102064696@tmomail.net"

"$2" represents the body of your email, and "-s $1" represents the subject.
